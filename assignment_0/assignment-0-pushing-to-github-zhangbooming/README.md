# Pushing to GitHub

The objective of this mock assignment is to demonstrate the format of assignments in this course. It also ensures that you know how to submit an assignment through GitHub. 

## Format of the Assignments

Each assignment provides a task, such as implementing a search algorithm or constructing a module in an inference engine. Detailed feature requirements of the task will be documented in **README.md**, such as this one. To complete the task, you need to modify **student_code.py** to implement required features. You may test your code by creating your own test cases that resemble the ones in **main.py** and running the script. 

When you are ready to turn in your work, make sure to commit all local changes in your repo and push the commit to GitHub. The last commit we find on GitHub will be used for grading.  

To grade your work, we will run test cases with your code. The test cases used for grading will resemble the ones given to you in main.py, though more comprehensive in assessing whether your work satisfied all requirements. To ensure that your code meets all requirements, we strongly encourage you to develop your own tests cases to test it before turning it in.  

## Task

Your task for this (mock) assignment is to modify the function in student_code.py so that the test case in main.py passes. Please make sure to commit and push your local work after you are finished.  

## Note

As with all future assignments, **only code in student_code.py will be used for grading**. Please ensure that all code / data of your work is contained in the file. Please only use libraries that are available for a bare-bone Python 3.7 installation (does not require additional pip / conda / etc. installation). Please do not remove or change the signature of any classes / functions in the file. You are free to add new functions and/or classes.
